			===GETTING STARTED===

Before running any scripts, please put your clip folder directory in the "ClipsLocation.txt" file.

Also put the location you want your clips to output to in "ClipOutput.txt"

After you input your Clip Directoreis, run "RunFirst.bat"

Run "Working.ahk"

Set your clip length in Medal to 5 Minutes





      		===Troubleshooting===
If your clips aren't saving to your output, edit the Working.AHK file and raise your delay (in miliseconds)

If that does not help, contact me through discord at -Josh-#1082. 

If my username has changed by the time this is released, I moderate at the Medal.tv discord server, and I'm sure you can find me there.
